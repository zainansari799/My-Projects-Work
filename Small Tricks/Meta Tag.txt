1. user-scalable:
You can disable zooming capabilities on mobile devices by adding "user-scalable=no" to the viewport meta tag. 
This attribute is mostly used when we render the page on mobile devices. 

2. width-device-width:
The width=device-width part sets the width of the page to follow the screen-width of the device (which will vary depending on the device).

3. initial-scale:
The initial-scale=1.0 part sets the initial zoom level when the page is first loaded by the browser.

4. maximum-scale:
If initial-scale=1 and maximum-scale=1,then it will not zoom in the page.
If initial-scale=1 and maximum scale=1.5, the we can zoom in 150% of the screen. 

5. minimum-scale:
This attribute provides facility how much you can zoom out from the page.

If initial-scale=1 and minimum-scale=1,then it will not zoom in the page.
If initial-scale=1 and minimum-scale=1.5, the we can zoom out 150% of the screen.

6. target-densitydpi
Support for target-densitydpi in the viewport meta tag was recently removed.

In Android browser and early versions of Chrome for Android, developers could use "target-densitydpi=device-dpi" viewport value to force the browser to make a CSS pixel the same size as a device pixel, 
which may cause content to appear incorrectly scaled on screen.

Best practice:
When designing a new mobile site, or updating existing pages, you should use modern techniques for dealing with high DPI displays; 
including always using <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width"> and a flexible layout for mobile sites. 

Result:
In  pubnub.com,
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.5">

it is the best use of meta tag, we are define how much we can zoom in the page and also define default page rendering.
